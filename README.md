# BAFExtract

BAFExtract generates the B-allele frequency shifts from mapped reads alone without the need for a heterozygous variant call set. BAFExtract a part of CaSpER (https://github.com/akdess/CaSpER) 

There are two steps:
1. Generation of the pileup.
2. Generation of the B-allele frequency profile.

Please open a new "issue" on github or contact authors Akdes.Harmanci@uth.tmc.edu or arif.o.harmanci@uth.tmc.edu for questions.
